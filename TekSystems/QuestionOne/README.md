##Question One
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is the earliest means of finding prime numbers.  A description can be found 
at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).  
Write an implementation of this in Java.  The program should take a maximum integer value as an input, and return the 
list of prime numbers between 0 and that 
number.  Provide unit tests.

###Solution
To execute program, please perform the following steps:
1. Build the application by either using an IDE or `./graldew build` command
2. Navigate to the following directory `./lib/build/Libs`
3. Run the following command `java -jar lib.jar`
